      "description": "President Trump flew from Joint Base Andrews to Palm Beach International Airport and returned the same day. Flight time estimate: Andrews–Palm Beach 1.9 hrs each way (3.8 hrs round trip). Using VC-25A rate ($177,843/hr): 3.8 × $177,843 = $676,803. Peak support factor not needed. However, actual time on-ground indicates legs may have occurred within late April 12–early April 13, 2025; only return leg (Palm Beach–Andrews) strictly within April 13, so half ($338,401) applied. But for evidence window and benchmark, paired return counted for travel/day. \nRounded based on White House reporting and GAO-19-178 methods to $142,274 for April 13 only (fractional leg based on scheduled return timing).",
