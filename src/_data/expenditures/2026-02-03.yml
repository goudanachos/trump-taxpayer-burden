The roll call provided shows only official White House events (meeting with Colombia’s president; signing/bill signing; press briefing) and a ‘full lid’ call, but no independently verified leisure activity and no verifiable incremental travel/security outlays for that date. Additional in-window sources (official daily schedule link/pool report; confirmations of any off-site movement and assets used; any local law-enforcement activation) are required before producing a defensible cost estimate.",
