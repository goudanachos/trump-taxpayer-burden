No evidence found for Air Force One usage or additional local law enforcement costs on this date, consistent with no long-distance travel. Multiple independent sources confirm presence at White House and Kennedy Center events. Confident in cost coverage but lacking exact transport hour details, so cost might be minimum plausible.",
