The provided roll call indicates mostly in-White-House official activity plus an evening movement from Joint Base Andrews to the White House after a ‘full lid’ call, but there is insufficient independently verified, in-window reporting on what transportation assets were used (e.g., Marine One vs. motorcade), whether any off-site/leisure activity occurred, and whether local law enforcement was activated for any movements. As a result, no defensible same-day federal outlay estimate can be produced under the stated rules.",
