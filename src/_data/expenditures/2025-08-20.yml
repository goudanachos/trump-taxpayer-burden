Public and investigative reporting from The Intercept, Reuters, Common Dreams, and ABC confirm that—the week of August 19-23, 2025—the combined federal security/military surge cost at least $1M per day, regardless of minimal presidential public events. While routine Secret Service/White House support is $75k/day, real outlays for this date far exceeded baseline due to continued occupation, National Guard logistics, out-of-state troop housing, and law enforcement overtime. Swearing-in event did not drive cost; surge posture did.",
