However, the city remained under elevated federal security and National Guard deployment due to ongoing executive directives. Secret Service and event security benchmarks suggest $75,000 is the baseline for on-site WH duty, but contemporaneous analysis (see Just Security, WTOP, DC police reporting) confirms a temporary surge in costs (~2x on-site rate) due to National Guard operations, DHS/DOJ task forces, and legal/police coordination. $160,000 estimated based on similar 2020–2024 high-activity days, with no additional airline/motorcade costs incurred.",
