      "description": "President Trump traveled by motorcade to Joe's Seafood in downtown Washington, D.C. for a private dinner with cabinet and staff. Federal outlays include on-site Secret Service/White House staff support for the day ($75,000) and an estimated $15,000 for the round-trip motorcade, as off-site motorcades in an urban area with high protest risk may run at the upper end of the range. Independent reports indicate increased law enforcement presence due to protests; however, no explicit activation of city police exceeding standard coordination was found. Incidentals are presumed under the cap, given no uniquely itemized claims.",
