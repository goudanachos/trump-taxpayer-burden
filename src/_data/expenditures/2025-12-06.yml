  "reason": "Tooling could not retrieve/verify primary-page content (URL scrape failures), and available in-window reporting does not provide sufficient detail to attribute incremental, taxpayer-funded leisure/recreation outlays specifically incurred on 2025-12-06 beyond baseline White House/USSS operations. In particular, there is no corroborated (2+ independent sources) quantitative evidence for: (a) any incremental Secret Service/operational security cost level (on-site vs peak off-site), (b) local law-enforcement activation costs, or (c) itemized federal venue/production costs for the Oval Office medal ceremony and State Department dinner. Without these, an estimate would be speculative and would violate the ‘actual outlays on target_date’ rule.",
