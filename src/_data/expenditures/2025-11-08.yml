The built-in news search tool only supports freshness up to the past month, which does not reach 2025-11-08 from today (2025-12-30). If you provide at least 6 open URLs published between 2025-11-01 and 2025-11-15 (e.g., White House daily guidance/pool reports, local law-enforcement activation notices, flight logs, or contemporaneous news coverage), I can compute the taxpayer-funded outlays for that date.",
