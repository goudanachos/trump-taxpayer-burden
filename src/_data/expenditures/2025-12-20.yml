In addition, no in-window sources found provide attributable, itemized federal outlays incurred on 2025-12-20 (aviation leg type/flight-hours, security posture, and whether local law-enforcement assistance was formally activated that day). Under the tracker rules, generating a dollar estimate without those confirmations would be speculative.",
