Without day-specific, in-window cost evidence, any total would be benchmark-only and would not satisfy the tracker’s rules for high-confidence attribution.",

    "At least two independent, in-window sources stating (or enabling calculation of) day-specific federal outlays for 2025-12-25 at Mar-a-Lago (e.g., Secret Service incremental/off-site surge cost for that date, or a DHS/OMB/GAO/IG release dated within the evidence window that provides an applicable per-day cost figure for off-site protection).",
    "At least two independent, in-window sources confirming whether Palm Beach County / City of Palm Beach law enforcement were activated on 2025-12-25 specifically and any published day-specific overtime/assist cost figures for that date."
