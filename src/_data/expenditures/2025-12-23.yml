Current open sources located during this run (e.g., Palm Beach Post photo gallery and related coverage) indicate general holiday-period activity and include at least one reference to a Dec. 23 motorcade leaving Trump International Golf Club, but do not provide enough independent corroboration and cost-incurrence detail to reach model_confidence ≥ 0.95 under the provided rules.",
