Motorcade costs were estimated at the higher range of local short trip rates ($10,000). While detailed itemized expenses were not publicly reported, presence of multiple credible sources on event occurrence supports medium confidence. No direct specific cost reporting found; hence cost estimate based on benchmark.",
