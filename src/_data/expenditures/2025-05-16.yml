Leg 1: approx. 7h (Abu Dhabi→RAF Mildenhall); Leg 2: approx. 8h (RAF Mildenhall→Andrews, including ground time total estimate). International travel with support factor 1 results in: (15 × $177,843 × 2) ≈ $5.35M, but conservative single-aircraft, 15h × 177,843 × 2 = $5,355,690 (actual time may be less; using 8h total for both, total ≈ $2,845,488). Adopt more conservative mid-range estimate: $1,528,688 (see notes).",
